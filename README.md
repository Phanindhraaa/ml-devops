## Overview

**ml-devops** provides a template for:
- Training ML models (using scikit-learn and the Iris dataset)
- Saving and loading models with joblib
- Containerizing the ML workflow with Docker
- Automating prediction and deployment tasks

## Features

- Python-based ML pipeline
- Dockerfile for easy containerization and deployment
- Automated model serialization and loading
- Example prediction script
- Ready-to-extend for your custom datasets and models

## Project Structure

```
app/
  ├── model.joblib      # Serialized ML model
  ├── predict.py        # Script for loading model and making predictions
  └── (other app files)
Dockerfile              # Docker configuration for the project
requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
README.md               # Project documentation
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Phanindhraaa/ml-devops.git
   cd ml-devops
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **(Optional) Build Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t ml-devops .
   ```

## Usage

### Predict with Pre-trained Model

Run the prediction script:
```bash
python app/predict.py
```
This will load the pre-trained model and print the predicted class for a sample Iris input.

### Train a Model

If you wish to retrain the model, add a training script (e.g., `train.py`) and update `model.joblib` accordingly.

## Docker Usage

To run the app inside a Docker container:
```bash
docker run --rm ml-devops
```
Customize the Dockerfile and Docker commands as needed for your deployment scenario.
